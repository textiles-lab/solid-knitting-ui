# SolidKnitting-Software
Software and UI Implementation for Solid Knitting machine.  

Some code was sourced from [stemkoski's Three.JS example code files](https://github.com/stemkoski/three.js/), specifically Voxel painter. 

### Currently, we have:
- Ability to set and delete cubes. 
- Ability to select various colors representing different cubes.
- Ability to move camera view up/down and right/left. 

### TODO:
- Make blocks jiggly.
- Implement logic to identify information between neighbor cubes.
